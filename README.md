# Canny Edge Detection
Implements Canny Edge Detection algorithm to detect edges in images. The program takes as an input a grayscale image, the sigma of the Gaussian filter
and the two low and high thresholds. The output is a binary image. Implements Gaussian convolution as a separable sequence of horizontal and vertical convolutions.

## Features

- Image Edge Detection
- Variable Algorithm Parameters

## Run Locally
